## Summary
We won the Government Statistics Section JSM Data Challenge. **We found that in mid-sized cars, vehicles that were in accidents with lower star ratings were more likely to have injured passengers (Figures 2 and 4).** We delve into this further with an interactive scatterplot (Figure 5), allowing the user to examine the specific make and star rating of each car, along with the % of accidents with at least one injured passenger. You will notice there is certainly a sparsity of data in these lower-stare regions, in terms of types of vehicles, however they do represent a decent proportion of the weighted sample (201,239.8 (8.1%)), since these are commonly purchased cars.

We are hoping this will pique your interest. **We would love your input! Perhaps we missed an important confounder, or maybe our data was too sparce to be conclusive.** All of the data can be found [here](https://github.com/LucyMcGowan/NHTSA-safety-analysis/tree/master/data) along with our [raw analysis files](https://github.com/LucyMcGowan/NHTSA-safety-analysis/blob/master/raw-code.Rmd)**.

###Background
* Each year millions of new cars are sold in the US. 
* 65% of new car consumers report that safety was their primary concern (Consumer National Reports Research Center, 2012)


<center>
<span style="color:#EB6864; font-size: 20pt">[We are interested in evaluating how effective these ratings are in preventing passenger injury in real world crashes]</span></center>

#### Saftey Ratings
* Safety tests are conducted by the NHTSA on a subset of cars each year 
* Tests are conducted under highly controlled circumstances with test dummies in the driver and front passenger seats 
    * frontal collision at 35 mph
    * side collision at 38.5 mph
* Each car model tested subsequently receives (among others) an overall rating out of 5 stars. 
* **Safety ratings are only comparable within weight class**

### Methods
#### Data Sources
* National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) General Estimates System (GES) for the years 2011-2014
    * Maximum injury severity
    * Accident condition variables (weather, point of impact, type of accident etc.)
    * Passenger-level variables (age, sex, alcohol, seat-belt use, etc.)

* NHTSA safety ratings (obtained from www.safercar.gov)
    * Overall safety rating
    * Weight of the vehicle
    * ***Note**: we obtained this data by scraping from the website; we attempted to contact NHTSA for a comprehensive list of ratings that was potentially more reliable than this method, but were not able to obtain one. Please let us know if you have access to this dataset!*

#### Weighting Scheme
* **Nationally representative probability sample** selected from all police-reported crashes. 
* **Eligibility**: 
    * A Police Accident Report must be completed for the crash
    * Crash must involve at least one motor vehicle traveling on a trafficway
    * Crash must result in property damage, injury, or death

1. **Stage 1** is a sample of geographic areas, called Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), from across the United States. The NASS GES divides the United States into 1,195 PSUs.
2. **Stage 2** is a sampling of police jurisdictions within each PSU based upon probability proportional to the number of crashes investigated in a given jurisdiction.  *An average of seven police jurisdictions have been selected within each PSU*.
3. **Stage 3** is the selection of crashes within the sampled police jurisdictions. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucyMcGowan/NHTSA-safety-analysis/master/figs/weighting-scheme-weight.png)

The weight is the product of the inverse of the probabilities of selection at each of the three stages in the sampling process.

#### Design
* Incorporating the design in the statistical analysis is vital
* In order to obtain the correct standard error estimates for a subpopulation, we need to properly account for the weights and design

* All analysis was completed using `R`
* We primarily utilized the **survey** package:
    * T. Lumley (2014) "survey: analysis of complex survey samples". R package version 3.30. 
    * T. Lumley (2004) Analysis of complex survey samples. Journal of Statistical Software  9(1): 1-19

#### Variable Definitions

<center>
<span style="color:#EB6864; font-size: 15pt">[**Outcome**: Maximum Injury Severity within Vehicle]</span></center>

*0*: No injury 

*1*: Some injury (ranging from possible to fatal) 

<center>
<span style="color:#EB6864; font-size: 15pt">[**Predictor of Interest**: NHTSA Overall Ratings]</span></center>

*5 Stars*: Injury risk for this vehicle is much less than average 

*4 Stars*: Injury risk for this vehicle is less than average to average 

*2 or 3 Stars*: Injury risk for this vehicle is average to greater than average or greater than average
*There were no one star vehicles in our data set*

**Adjusted for:**

* Seat restraint misuse 
* Speeding 
* Indicator for interstate highway 
* Weather  
* Impact location 
* Alcohol involvement 
* Indicator for rollover 
* Indicator for airbag deployment 
* Manner of collision 
* Age 
* Sex 
* Age x Sex 

**Fit a logistic model:**

* Injured versus uninjured
* Adjusted for all covariates shown previously
* Fit an interaction between rating x weight class


### Results
* Weighted sample: N=2,595,190
* Unweighted sample: N=19,428
* Merged 4 years of data (2011-2014)
* Included vehicles:
    * had a safety rating (2011+)
    * had passengers with known injury severity 

Maximum Injury in Vehicle |	Weighted frequency (%)
------------------------|-----------------------
No injury |	2,170,141.59 (83.6%)
Injury |	425,048.1 (16.4%)

NHTSA Safety Rating |	Weighted frequency (%)
--------------------|-----------------------
5-stars |	936,457.93 (36.1%)
4-stars	| 1,448,491.93 (55.8%)
2- or 3-stars | 201,239.8 (8.1%)


Figures 1, 2, and 3 show the injury & safety ratings by weight class. Figure 2 shows the concerning result that 2-3 star rated cars in the mid-size weight class have proportionally fewer injuries. These results hold true after adjusting for the covariates, this result held true (Figure 4). **Here is where we would love your input! Perhaps we missed an important confounder. All of the data can be found [here](https://github.com/LucyMcGowan/NHTSA-safety-analysis/tree/master/data) along with our [raw analysis files](https://github.com/LucyMcGowan/NHTSA-safety-analysis/blob/master/raw-code.Rmd)**.

To delve into this further, we have an interactive scatter plot, which allows the user to examine the specific make and star rating of each car, along with the % of accidents with at least one injured passenger (Figure 5).

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.cap = "Figure 5: Percent Injured by rating"}
#create a table of proportion injured by car type
t<-prop.table(svytable(~mm.id+injured,subset(subset,vehicle.weight3==1)),1)
t.injured<-data.frame(mm.id=rownames(t),injured=t[,2])
#get unique cars for subset dataset
unique<-unique(subset.data[,c("rating","make.name","model.name","mm.id")])
#merge data
t2<-merge(t.injured,unique[,c("rating","make.name","model.name","mm.id")],by="mm.id")

x <- list(
  title = "% vehicles with injury"
)
y <- list(
  title = "Rating"
)

plot_ly(data = t2, x = ~injured, y = ~rating, type = "scatter", mode = "markers", color = ~make.name) %>%
    layout( xaxis=x,yaxis=y)
```

### Conclusions
We have some evidence to show that ratings contribute to whether or not passengers are injured, however this relationship is complex.

#### Limitations
* This analysis was limited to vehicles that were in accidents – we don’t know the distribution of ratings in the general population
* It is possible that 4 or 5 star cars are more likely to be rated than 2 or 3 star cars
* Limiting ourselves to using ratings from 2011-2014 drastically decreased our sample size and limited the information about other cars involved in each accident
* We were only able to observe 330 unique make/model/year combinations
